# SandBoxV2 aka ProductStore

ProductStore is a web app that allows you to add and view products.

## Getting Started
In order to get started you need the deployed files which I or my liaison have already sent to you. Once you have those refer to the steps below:

Navigate to the .exe file, right click and run it. Grab one of the urls on the command line and paste to the browser. See images below:

## Deployment

Alternatively you can try to deploy to iis webserver and run it there.

## Debuging

Clone the repository and open it in visual Studio (I debuged in visual studio 2017). Chose the SandBoxV2 solution and then run it. It may take several minutes because it may have restore some npm packages. Runing it via anuglar cli may cause some errors due to the current url configuration.
